#CIS 375 – Semester Project - ACFramework#

This program was written with the ACFramework version 2.04.

This project is to help us learn how to correctly and efficiently design, develop, and deliver a piece of software based upon a ready-made code framework.

This game has a 3D player model surviving against waves of enemy ‘zombie critters’. The player must use their weapons to eliminate enemies and make it to the next room. After a few rooms, a final boss room will be opened for the player. Once the player defeats the final boss critter, the game is over and they win. If the player loses all of their health, they lose.

Contributing

Please use separate branching unless you are confident in what you are committing.

git branch <branch name>

ex: git branch jeradmeterko //make a new branch jeradmeterko

git checkout jeradmeterko //navigate to the new branch and begin programming

git add . || git add <filename> //add new files to staging area

git commit –m “message” //commit added files with –m “a message” Please read this important article on git commit messages: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/ git push https://github.com/jmeterko/cis375-anderson-mengel-meterko.git

//this will push your ‘committed’ code to our GitHub repo.

//if the above command fails, read the git output and see what you need to fix

git pull master //do this often to make sure you are updated on code
