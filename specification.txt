PROJECT REQUIREMENTS (taken from the specification document):

1)
   At least 3 distinct rooms with doorways between rooms (portal
or teleportation device[s])
2)
   At least 4 distinct walls
3)
   One ‘permanent’ MD2 model character other than the player.
(made without seedCritters)
4)

   The use of at least one key (on the keyboard) not included
within the original version of the AC Framework. Must have a different use
other than the current uses of keys. You must make your own listener class,
derived from another listener class.
9)
   At least 3 bitmaps (textures) not included in the original
version.
10) At

Project Requirements Fulfillment
 
The following numbers correspond to Section 1.4. We are going to complete the project requirements as follows:
 
1)    Using 3 “wave rooms” where player must cross the room of zombies to make it to next room. The final, fourth room is the boss area.
 
2)
   Each room will have a different layout of critter walls,
forcing the player to move through ‘hallways’
 
3)
  The boss critter will be our permanent model, since we are giving
this enemy different behaviors and health from the normal enemies.
 
4)
   We will be making 3 different types of zombies, each using a
different class.
            Examples of different Zombie types (classes):
                        - zombieTank: Increased health, slower speed.
                        - zombieRunner: Decreased health, faster speed.
                        - zombieWalker: Average health and speed.
 
5)
   Using different model states for:
1. When player and zombies taking damage
2. When player fires weapon
3. When player switches weapon
4. When player dies
5. When player and zombies move
 
6)
   The moving wall will be a bigger door that opens, revealing
the path to the boss room.
 
 
9)
   Adding new textures for wall, floor, and ceiling.
 
10) Zombie
sound, gun sound, boss sound, and victory sound.
 
12) At least 1 win to win and 1 way to lose. (Enable a cheat to override loss)

KNOWN BUGS
============================================================================================================================

Bitmap glitch (all walls and other textures have a 'rainbow' effect
Model polys color glitch (all polys on player and enemies flash colors like the bitmap glitch) Does original framework do this?

FEATURES (Ideas to implement if enough time is present
============================================================================================================================
Sniper gun mode. Slow to shoot, but shots do high damage and pierce targets. 
WASD movability
